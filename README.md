# FluidSimGPU

WORK IN PROGRESS  


This is my 3rd project for my computer science degree. It is currently in an unfinished state but demonstrates 
a basic version of what I had in mind.

The aim is to create a simple fluid sandbox in 2D following the work of researchers at Nvidia:

To achieve good performance the algorithm has been implemented in parallel on the GPU using compute shaders 
from the OpenGL library. Graphics are also handled by OpenGL.
